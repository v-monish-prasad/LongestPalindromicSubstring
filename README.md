Longest Palindromic Substring

Given a string A of size N, find and return the longest palindromic substring in A.

Substring of string A is A[i...j] where 0 <= i <= j < len(A)

Palindrome string:
A string which reads the same backwards. More formally, A is palindrome if reverse(A) = A

Example Input

Input 1:
A = "aaaabaaa"

Input 2:
A = "abba
